# ESP-32-Human-sensor
This project uses an ESP32 WROOM module and a HLK-LD2410s sensor to create a human presence detector. The ESP32 hosts a web server that displays whether a human is detected. The webpage auto-refreshes every second for real-time updates. The code includes a debounce mechanism for sensor reliability
